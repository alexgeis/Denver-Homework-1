Homework regarding semantic HTML and CSS updates.

For this assignment I first went through the HTML and updated the elements to be more semantic.
I also added alt attributes to all image elements (include the hero image), and corrected ID/class groupings for the CSS file and anchor links.

Then, I went through the CSS and labeled the functions (or lack of) within the current code.

There were many CSS redundancies, so I refactored those into consolidated classes and commented out the depracated code. I applied my new classes and ensured the float properties were correctly affecting the onscreen elements.
